## Independent Variables: Distance, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator), SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), Soncumed Airtime, Frequency MHz, Bandwidth KHz, Coding Rate, Percentage of Humidity.
- Distance: The physical distance between the transmitter and the receiver.
- RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator): Indicator of the received signal power.
- SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures the signal quality by comparing the signal strength with the background noise level.
- Concumed Airtime: The channel occupancy time.
- Frequency MHz: Operating frequency in megahertz.
- Bandwidth KHz: Signal bandwidth in kilohertz.
- Coding Rate: The rate at which data is encoded for transmission.
- Percentage of Humidity: Relative humidity percentage in the environment.

## Dependent Variable (f(x)): SF
- "SF" stands for "Spreading Factor." In communication systems like LoRa (Long Range), Spreading Factor refers to the rate at which data is spread or expanded over the available channel bandwidth. It determines the duration of each bit, with higher spreading factors resulting in longer transmission times and increased robustness in signal reception at the expense of reduced data rate. Essentially, the Spreading Factor directly impacts the range and performance of the communication system, allowing for trade-offs between range, data rate, and resilience to interference and noise.
